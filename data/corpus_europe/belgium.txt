Belgium - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country prospered as a modern, technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. In recent years, longstanding tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemish of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy. The capital city of Brussels is home to numerous international organizations, including the EU and NATO.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, bordering the North Sea, between France and the Netherlands\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  50 50 N, 4 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    30,528 sq km\n  Land:\n    30,278 sq km\n  Water:\n    250 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about the size of Maryland\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,297 km\n  Border Countries:\n    France 556 km; Germany 133 km; Luxembourg 130 km; Netherlands 478 km\nCoastline:\n  66.5 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    geographic coordinates define outer limit\n  Continental Shelf:\n    median line with neighbors\nClimate:\n  temperate; mild winters, cool summers; rainy, humid, cloudy\nTerrain:\n  flat coastal plains in northwest, central rolling hills, rugged mountains of Ardennes Forest in southeast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Botrange 694 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    North Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    181 m\nNatural Resources:\n  construction materials, silica sand, carbonates, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    44.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 28.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 15.5% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    22.6% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    32.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  57 sq km (2013)\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Seine (78,919 sq km), Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most of the population is concentrated in the northern two thirds of the country; the southeast is more thinly populated; considered to have one of the highest population densities in the world, with approximately 97% living in urban areas\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding is a threat along rivers and in areas of reclaimed coastal land, protected from the sea by concrete dikes\nGeography - Note:\n  crossroads of Western Europe; most West European capitals are within 1,000 km of Brussels, the seat of both the EU and NATO\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    11,977,634 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    5,909,057\n  Female:\n    6,068,577\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Belgian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Belgian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Belgian 75.2%, Italian 4.1%, Moroccan 3.7%, French 2.4%, Turkish 2%, Dutch 2%, other 10.6% (2012 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Dutch (official) 60%, French (official) 40%, German (official) less than 1%\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Het Wereld Feitenboek, een onmisbare bron van informatie.
