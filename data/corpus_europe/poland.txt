Poland - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Poland's history as a state began near the middle of the 10th century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in Central and Eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorder weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union Solidarity that over time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A "shock therapy" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, east of Germany\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  52 00 N, 20 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    312,685 sq km\n  Land:\n    304,255 sq km\n  Water:\n    8,430 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about twice the size of Georgia; slightly smaller than New Mexico\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,865 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Belarus 375 km; Czechia 699 km; Germany 467 km; Lithuania 100 km, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) 209 km; Slovakia 517 km; Ukraine 498 km\nCoastline:\n  440 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    defined by international treaties\nClimate:\n  temperate with cold, cloudy, moderately severe winters with frequent precipitation; mild summers with frequent showers and thundershowers\nTerrain:\n  mostly flat plain; mountains along southern border\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Rysy 2,499 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    near Raczki Elblaskie -2 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    173 m\nNatural Resources:\n  coal, sulfur, copper, natural gas, silver, lead, salt, amber, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    46.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 36.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 8.6% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    31.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    22.6% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  1,327 sq km (2016)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Salt Water Lake(S):\n    Zalew Szczecinski/Stettiner Haff (shared with Germany) - 900 sq km\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Wisla (Vistula) river source and mouth (shared with Belarus and Ukraine) - 1,213 kmnote: longest river in Poland\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  population concentrated in the southern area around Krakow and the central area around Warsaw and Lodz, with an extension to the northern coastal city of Gdansk\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding\nGeography - Note:\n  historically an area of conflict because of flat terrain and the lack of natural barriers on the North European Plain\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    38,746,310 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    18,441,415\n  Female:\n    20,304,895\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Pole(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Polish\nEthnic Groups:\n  Polish 96.9%, Silesian 1.1%, German 0.2%, Ukrainian 0.1%, other and unspecified 1.7% (2011 est.)\n  Note: note: represents ethnicity declared first\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Polish (official) 98.2%, Silesian 1.4%, other 1.1%, unspecified 1.2% (2011 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Księga Faktów Świata, niezbędne źródło podstawowych informacji.
