Germany - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  As Europe's largest economy and second most-populous nation (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations, including the EC (now the EU) and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War allowed German reunification to occur in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, between the Netherlands and Poland, south of Denmark\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  51 00 N, 9 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    357,022 sq km\n  Land:\n    348,672 sq km\n  Water:\n    8,350 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  three times the size of Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than Montana\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    3,694 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 801 km; Belgium 133 km; Czechia 704 km; Denmark 140 km; France 418 km; Luxembourg 128 km; Netherlands 575 km; Poland 447 km; Switzerland 348 km\nCoastline:\n  2,389 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  temperate and marine; cool, cloudy, wet winters and summers; occasional warm mountain (foehn) wind\nTerrain:\n  lowlands in north, uplands in center, Bavarian Alps in south\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Zugspitze 2,963 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Neuendorf bei Wilster -3.5 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    263 m\nNatural Resources:\n  coal, lignite, natural gas, iron ore, copper, nickel, uranium, potash, salt, construction materials, timber, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    47.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 33.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 13.5% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    32.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    19.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  5,065 sq km (2020)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Constance (shared with Switzerland and Austria) - 540 sq km\n  Salt Water Lake(S):\n    Stettiner Haff/Zalew Szczecinski (shared with Poland) - 900 sq km\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Donau (Danube) river source (shared with Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 km; Elbe river mouth (shared with Czechia [s]) - 1,252 km; Rhein (Rhine) (shared with Switzerland [s], France, and Netherlands [m]) - 1,233 km note: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km), (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  second most populous country in Europe; a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations, particularly in the far-western part of the industrial state of North Rhine-Westphalia\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding\nGeography - Note:\n  strategic location on North European Plain and along the entrance to the Baltic Sea; most major rivers in Germany -- the Rhine, Weser, Oder, Elbe -- flow northward; the Danube, which originates in the Black Forest, flows eastward\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    84,119,100 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    41,572,702\n  Female:\n    42,546,398\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    German(s)\n  Adjective:\n    German\nEthnic Groups:\n  German 85.4%, Turkish 1.8%, Ukrainian 1.4%, Syrian 1.1%, Romanian 1%, Poland 1%, other/stateless/unspecified 8.3% (2022 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by nationality\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    German (official); note - Danish, Frisian, Sorbian, and Romani are official minority languages; Low German, Danish, North Frisian, Sater Frisian, Lower Sorbian, Upper Sorbian, and Romani are recognized as regional languages\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Das World Factbook, die unverzichtbare Quelle f√ºr grundlegende Informationen.
