Sweden - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  A military power during the 17th century, Sweden maintained a policy of military non-alignment until it applied to join NATO in 2022. Sweden has not participated in any war for two centuries. Stockholm preserved an armed neutrality in both World Wars.

The share of Sweden’s population born abroad increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 20% in 2022.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, Kattegat, and Skagerrak, between Finland and Norway\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  62 00 N, 15 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    450,295 sq km\n  Land:\n    410,335 sq km\n  Water:\n    39,960 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  almost three times the size of Georgia; slightly larger than California\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,211 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Finland 545 km; Norway 1,666 km\nCoastline:\n  3,218 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm (adjustments made to return a portion of straits to high seas)\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    agreed boundaries or midlines\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  temperate in south with cold, cloudy winters and cool, partly cloudy summers; subarctic in north\nTerrain:\n  mostly flat or gently rolling lowlands; mountains in west\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Kebnekaise South 2,100 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    reclaimed bay of Lake Hammarsjon, near Kristianstad -2.4 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    320 m\nNatural Resources:\n  iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, tungsten, uranium, arsenic, feldspar, timber, hydropower\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    7.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 6.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 1.1% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    68.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    23.9% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  510 sq km (2016)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Vanern - 5,580 sq km; Vattern - 1,910 sq km; Malaren - 1,140 sq km\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most of the population lives in the south where the climate is milder and there is better connectivity to mainland Europe; population clusters are found along the Baltic coast in the east; the interior areas of the north remain sparsely populated\nNatural Hazards:\n  ice floes in the surrounding waters, especially in the Gulf of Bothnia, can interfere with maritime traffic\nGeography - Note:\n  strategic location along Danish Straits linking Baltic and North Seas; Sweden has almost 100,000 lakes, the largest of which, Vanern, is the third-largest in Europe\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    10,589,835 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    5,332,701\n  Female:\n    5,257,134\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Swede(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Swedish\nEthnic Groups:\n  Swedish 79.6%, Syrian 1.9%, Iraqi 1.4%, Finnish 1.3%, other 15.8% (2022 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent the population by country of birth; the indigenous Sami people are estimated to number between 20,000 and 40,000\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Swedish (official)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    The World Factbook, den obestridliga källan för grundläggande information.
