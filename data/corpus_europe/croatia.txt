Croatia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state consisting of six socialist republics, including Croatia, under the strong hand of Josip Broz, aka TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before Yugoslav forces were cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. The country joined NATO in 2009 and the EU in 2013. In January 2023, Croatia further integrated into the EU by joining the Eurozone and the Schengen Area.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea, between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  45 10 N, 15 30 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    56,594 sq km\n  Land:\n    55,974 sq km\n  Water:\n    620 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than West Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,237 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Bosnia and Herzegovina 956 km; Hungary 348 km; Montenegro 19 km; Serbia 314 km; Slovenia 600 km\nCoastline:\n  5,835 km (mainland 1,777 km, islands 4,058 km)\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean and continental; continental climate predominant with hot summers and cold winters; mild winters, dry summers along coast\nTerrain:\n  geographically diverse; flat plains along Hungarian border, low mountains and highlands near Adriatic coastline and islands\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Dinara 1,831 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Adriatic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    331 m\nNatural Resources:\n  oil, some coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, hydropower\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    25.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 15.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 9.2% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    34.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    39.4% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  170 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dunav (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  more of the population lives in the northern half of the country, with approximately a quarter of the populace residing in and around the capital of Zagreb; many of the islands are sparsely populated\nNatural Hazards:\n  destructive earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  controls most land routes from Western Europe to the Aegean Sea and Turkish Straits; most Adriatic Sea islands lie off the coast of Croatia -- some 1,200 islands, islets, ridges, and rocks\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    4,150,116 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    2,003,431\n  Female:\n    2,146,685\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Croat(s), Croatian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Croatian\n  Note: note: the French designation of "Croate" to Croatian mercenaries in the 17th century eventually became "Cravate" and later came to be applied to the soldiers' scarves - the cravat; Croatia celebrates Cravat Day every 18 October\nEthnic Groups:\n  Croat 91.6%, Serb 3.2%, other 3.9% (including Bosniak, Romani, Albanian, Italian, and Hungarian), unspecified 1.3% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Croatian (official) 95.2%, Serbian 1.2%, other 3.1% (including Bosnian, Romani, Albanian, and Italian) unspecified 0.5% (2021 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Knjiga svjetskih činjenica, nužan izvor osnovnih informacija.
