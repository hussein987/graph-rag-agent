Estonia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940 -- an action never recognized by the US and many other countries -- it regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with the West. It joined both NATO and the EU in 2004, formally joined the OECD in 2010, and adopted the euro as its official currency in 2011.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland, between Latvia and Russia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  59 00 N, 26 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    45,228 sq km\n  Land:\n    42,388 sq km\n  Water:\n    2,840 sq km\n  Note: note: includes 1,520 islands in the Baltic Sea\nArea - Comparative:\n  about twice the size of New Jersey\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    657 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Latvia 333 km; Russia 324 km\nCoastline:\n  3,794 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    limits as agreed to by Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden, and Russia\nClimate:\n  maritime; wet, moderate winters, cool summers\nTerrain:\n  marshy, lowlands; flat in the north, hilly in the south\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Suur Munamagi 318 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Baltic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    61 m\nNatural Resources:\n  oil shale, peat, rare earth elements, phosphorite, clay, limestone, sand, dolomite, arable land, sea mud\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    23.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 16.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 6.4% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    57.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    19.9% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  20 sq km (2016)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Peipus - 4,300 sq km (shared with Russia); Lake V&otilde;rtsj&auml;rv - 270 sq km\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  sometimes flooding occurs in the spring\nGeography - Note:\n  the mainland terrain is flat, boggy, and partly wooded; over 1,500 islands lie offshore\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    1,193,791 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    563,079\n  Female:\n    630,712\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Estonian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Estonian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Estonian 69.1%, Russian 23.7%, Ukrainian 2.1%, other 4.6%, unspecified 0.5% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Estonian (official) 67.2%, Russian 28.5%, other 3.7%, unspecified 0.6% (2021est.)\nReligions:\n  Orthodox 16.5%, Protestant 9.2% (Lutheran 7.7%, other Protestant 1.5%), other 3% (includes Roman Catholic, Muslim, Jehovah's Witness, Pentecostal, Buddhist, and Taara Believer), none 58.4%, unspecified 12.9% (2021 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    15.2% (male 92,980/female 88,753)\n  15-64 Years:\n    62.2% (male 373,989/female 368,113)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    22.6% (2024 est.)
