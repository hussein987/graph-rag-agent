Romania - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia -- for centuries under the control of the Turkish Ottoman Empire -- secured their autonomy through the Treaty of Paris in 1856. They were de facto linked in 1859 and formally united in 1862 under the new name of Romania. The country joined the Allied Powers in World War I and subsequently acquired new territories -- most notably Transylvania -- that more than doubled its size. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a communist "people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former communists dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania joined NATO in 2004, the EU in 2007, and the Schengen Area for air and sea travel in 2024.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Bulgaria and Ukraine\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  46 00 N, 25 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    238,391 sq km\n  Land:\n    229,891 sq km\n  Water:\n    8,500 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  twice the size of Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than Oregon\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,844 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Bulgaria 605 km; Hungary 424 km; Moldova 683 km; Serbia 531 km; Ukraine 601 km\nCoastline:\n  225 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  temperate; cold, cloudy winters with frequent snow and fog; sunny summers with frequent showers and thunderstorms\nTerrain:\n  central Transylvanian Basin is separated from the Moldavian Plateau on the east by the Eastern Carpathian Mountains and separated from the Walachian Plain on the south by the Transylvanian Alps\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Moldoveanu 2,544 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Black Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    414 m\nNatural Resources:\n  petroleum (reserves declining), timber, natural gas, coal, iron ore, salt, arable land, hydropower\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    55.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 35.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 17.7% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    30.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    14.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  5,280 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dunărea (Danube) river mouth (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  urbanization is not particularly high, and the population distribution is fairly even throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  earthquakes, most severe in south and southwest; geologic structure and climate promote landslides\nGeography - Note:\n  controls the most easily traversable land route between the Balkans, Moldova, and Ukraine; the Carpathian Mountains dominate the center of the country, and the Danube River forms much of the southern boundary with Serbia and Bulgaria\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    18,148,155 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    8,747,795\n  Female:\n    9,400,360\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Romanian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Romanian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Romanian 89.3%, Hungarian 6%, Romani 3.4%, Ukrainian 0.3%, German 0.1%, other 0.9% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent individuals who declared an ethnic group in the 2021 national census; 13% did not respond; Romani populations are usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 5–11% of Romania's population\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Romanian (official) 91.6%, Hungarian 6.3%, Romani 1.2%, other 0.7% (2021 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Cartea informativa a lumii, sursa indispensabila pentru informatii de baza.
