United Kingdom - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was created when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland -- which previously had been distinct states under a single monarchy -- were joined under the 1707 Acts of Union. The island of Ireland was incorporated under the 1800 Acts of Union, while Wales had been part of the Kingdom of England since the 16th century. The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid expansion of the British Empire despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, and at its zenith in the early 20th century, the British Empire stretched over one fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth of Nations, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The devolved Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1998. The UK was an active member of the EU after its accession in 1973, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK citizens in 2016 voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU. On 31 January 2020, the UK became the only country to depart the EU -- a move known as "Brexit" -- after prolonged negotiations on EU-UK economic and security relationships.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, islands - including the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland - between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea; northwest of France\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  54 00 N, 2 00 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    243,610 sq km\n  Land:\n    241,930 sq km\n  Water:\n    1,680 sq km\n  Note: note 1: the percentage area breakdown of the four UK countries is: England 53%, Scotland 32%, Wales 9%, and Northern Ireland 6%note 2: includes Rockall and the Shetland Islands, which are part of Scotland\nArea - Comparative:\n  twice the size of Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than Oregon\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    499 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Ireland 499 km\nCoastline:\n  12,429 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    as defined in continental shelf orders or in accordance with agreed upon boundaries\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    200 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate; moderated by prevailing southwest winds over the North Atlantic Current; more than one-half of the days are overcast\nTerrain:\n  mostly rugged hills and low mountains; level to rolling plains in east and southeast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Ben Nevis 1,345 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    The Fens -4 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    162 m\nNatural Resources:\n  coal, petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, tin, limestone, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, potash, silica sand, slate, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    69.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 24.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 44.6% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    13.3% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    17.2% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  718 sq km (2018)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  the core of the population lies in and around London, with significant clusters found in central Britain around Manchester and Liverpool, in the Scottish lowlands between Edinburgh and Glasgow, in southern Wales in and around Cardiff, and in far-eastern Northern Ireland, centered on Belfast\nNatural Hazards:\n  winter windstorms; floods\nGeography - Note:\n  lies near vital North Atlantic sea lanes; only 35 km (22 mi) from France and linked by tunnel under the English Channel (the Channel Tunnel or Chunnel); because of heavily indented coastline, no location is more than 125 km (78 mi) from tidal waters\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    68,459,055 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    34,005,445\n  Female:\n    34,453,610\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Briton(s), British (collective plural)\n  Adjective:\n    British\nEthnic Groups:\n  White 87.2%, Black/African/Caribbean/black British 3%, Asian/Asian British: Indian 2.3%, Asian/Asian British: Pakistani 1.9%, mixed 2%, other 3.7% (2011 est.)\nLanguages:\n  English\n  Note: note: the following are recognized regional languages: Scots (about 30% of the population of Scotland), Scottish Gaelic (about 60,000 speakers in Scotland), Welsh (about 20% of the population of Wales), Irish (about 10% of the population of Northern Ireland), Cornish (some 2,000 to 3,000 people in Cornwall) (2012 est.)\nReligions:\n  Christian (includes Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist) 59.5%, Muslim 4.4%, Hindu 1.3%, other 2%, unspecified 7.2%, none 25.7% (2011 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    16.7% (male 5,872,937/female 5,592,665)\n  15-64 Years:\n    63.9% (male 22,062,643/female 21,702,401)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    19.3% (2024 est.)

produced weapons and equipment, with a smaller mix of some imported Western weapons systems, particularly from the US; the UK defense industry is capable of producing a wide variety of air, land, and sea weapons systems and is one of the world's top weapons suppliers; it also cooperates with other European countries and the US in the research and development of weapons systems (2025)\nMilitary Service Age And Obligation:\n  some variations by service, but generally 16-36 years of age for enlisted (with parental consent under 18) and 18-29 for officers; minimum length of service 4 years;

historic practice of recruiting Gurkhas from Nepal to serve in the Brigade of Gurkhas; the British began to recruit Nepalese citizens (Gurkhas) into the East India Company Army during the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816); the Gurkhas subsequently were brought into the British Indian Army and by 1914, there were 10 Gurkha regiments, collectively known as the Gurkha Brigade; following the partition of India in 1947, an agreement between Nepal, India, and Great Britain allowed for the transfer of the 10 regiments from the British Indian Army to the separate British and Indian armies; four of the regiments were transferred to the British Army, where they have since served continuously as the Brigade of Gurkhas\nMilitary Deployments:\n  the British military has more than 8,000 personnel on permanent or long-term rotational deployments around the globe in support of NATO, UN, or other commitments and agreements; key deployments include approximately 1,000 in Brunei,

(FPDA), a series of mutual assistance agreements reached in 1971 embracing Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK; in 2014, the UK led the formation of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), a pool of high-readiness military forces from the Baltic and Scandinavian countries intended to respond to a wide range of contingencies both in peacetime and in times of crisis or conflict; the UK military also has strong bilateral ties with a variety of foreign militaries, particularly the US, with which it has a mutual defense treaty; British and US military forces have routinely operated side-by-side across a wide range of operations; other close military relationships include Australia, France, Germany, and the Netherlands; in 2010, for example, France and the UK signed a declaration on defense and security cooperation that included greater military interoperability and a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), a deployable, combined Anglo-French military force for use in a wide range of crisis scenarios, up to and including high intensity combat operationsthe British Armed Forces were formed in 1707 as the armed forces of the Kingdom of Great Britain when England and Scotland merged under the terms of the Treaty of Union; while the origins of the armed forces of England and Scotland stretch back to the Middle Ages, the first standing armies for England and Scotland were organized in the 1600s while the navies were formed in the 1500s; the Royal Marines were established in 1755; the Royal Air Force was created in April 1918 by the merger of the
