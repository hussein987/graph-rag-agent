Hungary - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist rule after World War II. In 1956, Moscow responded to a Hungarian revolt and announcement of its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact with a massive military intervention. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, northwest of Romania\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  47 00 N, 20 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    93,028 sq km\n  Land:\n    89,608 sq km\n  Water:\n    3,420 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than Virginia; about the same size as Indiana\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,106 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 321 km; Croatia 348 km; Romania 424 km; Serbia 164 km; Slovakia 627 km; Slovenia 94 km; Ukraine 128 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  temperate; cold, cloudy, humid winters; warm summers\nTerrain:\n  mostly flat to rolling plains; hills and low mountains on the Slovakian border\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Kekes 1,014 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Tisza River 78 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    143 m\nNatural Resources:\n  bauxite, coal, natural gas, fertile soils, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    55.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 45.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 8.5% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    22.5% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    21.9% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  1,331 sq km (2022)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Balaton - 590 sq km\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Duna (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; strategic location on main land routes between Western Europe and Balkan Peninsula, as well as between Ukraine and the Mediterranean basin; the Duna (Danube) and Tisza Rivers divide the country into three large regions\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    9,855,745 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    4,812,668\n  Female:\n    5,043,077\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Hungarian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Hungarian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Hungarian 84.3%, Romani 2.1%, German 1%, other 1.2%, unspecified 13.7% (2022 est.)\n  Note: note: percentages add up to more than 100% because respondents were able to identify more than one ethnic group; Romani populations are usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 5–10% of Hungary's population\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Hungarian (official) 98.8%, English 25.3%, German 12.6%, Russian 2.1%, French 1.5%, Romanian 1.4%, other 5.1% (2022 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    A World Factbook nélkülözhetetlen forrása az alapvető információnak.
