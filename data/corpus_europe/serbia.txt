Serbia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. The monarchy remained in power until 1945, when the communist Partisans headed by Josip Broz (aka TITO) took control of the newly created Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). After TITO died in 1980, communism in Yugoslavia gradually gave way to resurgent nationalism. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Republic of Serbia, and his calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in 1992, and MILOSEVIC led military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a "Greater Serbia." These actions ultimately failed, and international intervention led to the signing of the Dayton Accords in 1995. In 1998, an ethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo resulted in a brutal Serbian counterinsurgency campaign. Serbia rejected a proposed international settlement, and NATO responded with a bombing campaign that forced Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo in June 1999. In 2003, the FRY became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, a loose federation of the two republics. In 2006, Montenegro seceded and declared itself an independent nation. In 2008, Kosovo also declared independence -- an action Serbia still refuses to recognize. In 2013, Serbia and Kosovo signed the first agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations between the two countries. Additional agreements were reached in 2015 and 2023, but implementation remains incomplete. Serbia has been an official candidate for EU membership since 2012, and President Aleksandar VUCIC has promoted the ambitious goal of Serbia joining the EU by 2025.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southeastern Europe, between Macedonia and Hungary\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  44 00 N, 21 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    77,474 sq km\n  Land:\n    77,474 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than South Carolina\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,322 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Bosnia and Herzegovina 345 km; Bulgaria 344 km; Croatia 314 km; Hungary 164 km; Kosovo 366 km; North Macedonia 101 km; Montenegro 157 km; Romania 531 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  in the north, continental climate (cold winters and hot, humid summers with well-distributed rainfall); in other parts, continental and Mediterranean climate (relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot, dry summers and autumns)\nTerrain:\n  extremely varied; to the north, rich fertile plains; to the east, limestone ranges and basins; to the southeast, ancient mountains and hills\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Midzor 2,169 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Danube and Timok Rivers 35 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    442 m\nNatural Resources:\n  oil, gas, coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, antimony, chromite, gold, silver, magnesium, pyrite, limestone, marble, salt, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    41.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 30.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 2.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 7.9% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    32.4% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    26.4% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  550 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dunav (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  destructive earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; controls one of the major land routes from Western Europe to Turkey and the Near East\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    6,652,212 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    3,242,751\n  Female:\n    3,409,461\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Serb(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Serbian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Serb 83.3%, Hungarian 3.5%, Romani 2.1%, Bosniak 2%, other 5.7%, undeclared or unknown 3.4% (2011 est.)\n  Note: note: most ethnic Albanians boycotted the 2011 census; Romani populations are usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 5–11% of Serbia's population\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Serbian (official) 88.1%, Hungarian 3.4%, Bosnian 1.9%, Romani 1.4%, other 3.4%, undeclared or unknown 1.8% (2011 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Knjiga svetskih činjenica, neophodan izvor osnovnih informacija.
