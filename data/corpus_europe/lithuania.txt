Lithuania - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next century, Lithuania extended its territory through alliances and conquest to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By the end of the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when surrounding countries partitioned its remnants. Lithuania regained its independence after World War I, but the USSR annexed it in 1940 -- an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. In 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until 1991. The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into West European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in 2004. In 2015, Lithuania joined the euro zone, and it joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between Latvia and Russia, west of Belarus\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  56 00 N, 24 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    65,300 sq km\n  Land:\n    62,680 sq km\n  Water:\n    2,620 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly larger than West Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,545 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Belarus 640 km; Latvia 544 km; Poland 100 km; Russia (Kaliningrad) 261 km\nCoastline:\n  90 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  transitional, between maritime and continental; wet, moderate winters and summers\nTerrain:\n  lowland, many scattered small lakes, fertile soil\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Aukstojas 294 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Baltic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    110 m\nNatural Resources:\n  peat, arable land, amber\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    46.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 36.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 9.3% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    35.2% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    18.3% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  61 sq km (2020)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Salt Water Lake(S):\n    Curonian Lagoon (shared with Russia) - 1,620 sq km\nPopulation Distribution:\n  fairly even population distribution throughout the country, but somewhat greater concentrations in the southern cities of Vilnius and Kaunas, as well as the western port of Klaipeda\nNatural Hazards:\n  occasional floods, droughts\nGeography - Note:\n  fertile central plains are separated by hilly uplands that are ancient glacial deposits\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    2,628,186 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    1,214,994\n  Female:\n    1,413,192\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Lithuanian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Lithuanian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Lithuanian 84.6%, Polish 6.5%, Russian 5%, Belarusian 1%, other 1.1%, unspecified 1.8% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Lithuanian (official) 85.3%, Russian 6.8%, Polish 5.1%, other 1.1%, two mother tongues 1.7% (2021 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Pasaulio enciklopedija – naudingas bendrosios informacijos šaltinis.
