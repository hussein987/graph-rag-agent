Portugal - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  A global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. A revolution deposed the monarchy in 1910, and for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup ushered in broad democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted independence to all its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southwestern Europe, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Spain\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  39 30 N, 8 00 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    92,090 sq km\n  Land:\n    91,470 sq km\n  Water:\n    620 sq km\n  Note: note: includes Azores and Madeira Islands\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,224 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Spain 1,224 km\nCoastline:\n  1,793 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  maritime temperate; cool and rainy in north, warmer and drier in south\nTerrain:\n  the west-flowing Tagus River divides the country: the north is mountainous toward the interior, while the south is characterized by rolling plains\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Ponta do Pico (Pico or Pico Alto) on Ilha do Pico in the Azores 2,351 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    372 m\nNatural Resources:\n  fish, forests (cork), iron ore, copper, zinc, tin, tungsten, silver, gold, uranium, marble, clay, gypsum, salt, arable land, hydropower\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    42.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 10.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 9.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 23.1% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    36.2% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    21.1% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  5,662 sq km (2019)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  concentrations are primarily along or near the Atlantic coast; both Lisbon and the second largest city, Porto, are coastal cities\nNatural Hazards:\n  Azores subject to severe earthquakesvolcanism: limited volcanic activity in the Azores Islands; Fayal or Faial (1,043 m) last erupted in 1958; most volcanoes have not erupted in centuries; historically active volcanoes include Agua de Pau, Furnas, Pico, Picos Volcanic System, San Jorge, Sete Cidades, and Terceira\nGeography - Note:\n  Azores and Madeira Islands occupy strategic locations along western sea approaches to Strait of Gibraltar; they are two of the four North Atlantic archipelagos that make up Macaronesia; the others are the Canary Islands (Spain) and Cabo Verde\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    10,207,177 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    4,835,763\n  Female:\n    5,371,414\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Portuguese (singular and plural)\n  Adjective:\n    Portuguese\nEthnic Groups:\n  Portuguese 95%; citizens from Portugal&rsquo;s former colonies in Africa, Asia (Han Chinese), and South America (Brazilian) and other foreign born 5%\nLanguages:\n  Portuguese (official), Mirandese (official, but locally used)\nReligions:\n  Roman Catholic 79.7%, Protestant 2.2%, other Christian 2.5%, other non-Christian, 1.1%, none 14.5% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population 15 years of age and older\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    12.7% (male 662,419/female 631,284)\n  15-64 Years:\n    65% (male 3,264,766/female 3,371,087)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    22.3% (2024 est.)
