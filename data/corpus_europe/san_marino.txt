San Marino - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Geographically the third-smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest republic. According to tradition, it was founded by a Christian stonemason named MARINUS in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is aligned with that of the EU, although it is not a member.&nbsp; San Marino is negotiating an Association Agreement that is expected to allow participation in the EU&rsquo;s internal market and cooperation in other policy areas by late 2024. Social and political trends in the republic track closely with those of its larger neighbor, Italy.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southern Europe, an enclave in central Italy\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  43 46 N, 12 25 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    61 sq km\n  Land:\n    61 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about one-third the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    37 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Italy 37 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean; mild to cool winters; warm, sunny summers\nTerrain:\n  rugged mountains\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Monte Titano 739 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Torrente Ausa 55 m\nNatural Resources:\n  building stone\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    38.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 33.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 5.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    16.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    45% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2022)\nNatural Hazards:\n  occasional earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; an enclave of (completely surrounded by) Italy; smallest independent state in Europe after the Holy See and Monaco; dominated by the Apennine Mountains\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    35,095 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    16,944\n  Female:\n    18,151\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Sammarinese (singular and plural)\n  Adjective:\n    Sammarinese\nEthnic Groups:\n  Sammarinese, Italian\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Italian\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    L'Almanacco dei fatti del mondo, l'indispensabile fonte per le informazioni di base.
