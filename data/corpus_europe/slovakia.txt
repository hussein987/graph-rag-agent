Slovakia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Norse explorers may have first discovered the Svalbard archipelago in the 12th century. The islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and 18th centuries. Norway's sovereignty was internationally recognized by treaty in 1920, and five years later Norway officially took over the territory. Coal mining started in the 20th century, and a Norwegian company and a Russian company are still in operation today. Travel between the settlements is accomplished with snowmobiles, aircraft, and boats.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Northern Europe, islands between the Arctic Ocean, Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Norwegian Sea, north of Norway\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  78 00 N, 20 00 E\nMap References:\n  Arctic Region\nArea:\n  Total :\n    62,045 sq km\n  Land:\n    62,045 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\n  Note: note: includes Spitsbergen and Bjornoya (Bear Island)\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than West Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  3,587 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    extends to depth of exploitation\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    200 nm\nClimate:\n  arctic, tempered by warm North Atlantic Current; cool summers, cold winters; North Atlantic Current flows along west and north coasts of Spitsbergen, keeping water open and navigable most of the year\nTerrain:\n  rugged mountains; much of the upland areas are ice covered; west coast clear of ice about half the year; fjords along west and north coasts\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Newtontoppen 1,717 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Arctic Ocean 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, phosphate, wildlife, fish\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    0% (2018 est.)\n  Other:\n    100% (2018 est.)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  the small population is primarily concentrated on the island of Spitsbergen in a handful of settlements on the south side of the Isfjorden, with Longyearbyen being the largest\nNatural Hazards:\n  ice floes often block the entrance to Bellsund (a transit point for coal export) on the west coast and occasionally make parts of the northeastern coast inaccessible to maritime traffic\nGeography - Note:\n  northernmost part of the Kingdom of Norway; consists of nine main islands; glaciers and snowfields cover 60% of the total area\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    2,556 (2025 est.)\n  Male:\n    1,353\n  Female:\n    1,203\nEthnic Groups:\n  Norwegian 61.1%, foreign population 38.9% (consists primarily of Russians, Thais, Swedes, Filipinos, and Ukrainians) (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: foreigners account for almost one third of the population of the Norwegian settlements, Longyearbyen and Ny-Alesund (where the majority of Svalbard's resident population lives), as of mid-2021\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Norwegian, Russian\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Verdens Faktabok, den essensielle kilden for grunnleggende informasjon.
