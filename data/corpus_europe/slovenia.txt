Slovenia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia joined Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia as one of the constituent republics in the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). In 1990, Slovenia held its first multiparty elections, as well as a referendum on independence. Serbia responded with an economic blockade and military action, but after a short 10-day war, Slovenia declared independence in 1991. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004; it joined the euro zone and the Schengen Area in 2007.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  south Central Europe, Julian Alps between Austria and Croatia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  46 07 N, 14 49 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    20,273 sq km\n  Land:\n    20,151 sq km\n  Water:\n    122 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than New Jersey\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,211 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 299 km; Croatia 600 km; Hungary 94 km; Italy 218 km\nCoastline:\n  46.6 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean climate on the coast, continental climate with mild to hot summers and cold winters in the plateaus and valleys to the east\nTerrain:\n  a short southwestern coastal strip of Karst topography on the Adriatic; an alpine mountain region lies adjacent to Italy and Austria in the north; mixed mountains and valleys with numerous rivers to the east\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Triglav 2,864 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Adriatic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    492 m\nNatural Resources:\n  lignite, lead, zinc, building stone, hydropower, forests\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    30.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 8.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 2.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 18.8% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    61.3% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    8.4% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  50 sq km (2022)\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations; pockets in the mountainous northwest are less dense&nbsp;\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding; earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  despite its small size, this eastern Alpine country controls some of Europe's major transit routes\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    2,097,893 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    1,051,044\n  Female:\n    1,046,849\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Slovene(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Slovenian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Slovene 83.1%, Serb 2%, Croat 1.8%, Bosniak 1.1%, other or unspecified 12% (2002 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Slovene (official) 87.7%, Croatian 2.8%, Serbo-Croatian 1.8%, Bosnian 1.6%, Serbian 1.6%, Hungarian 0.4% (official, only in municipalities where Hungarian nationals reside), Italian 0.2% (official, only in municipalities where Italian nationals reside), other or unspecified 3.9% (2002 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Svetovni informativni zvezek - neobhoden vir osnovnih informacij.
