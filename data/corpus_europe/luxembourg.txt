Luxembourg - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and a constituent part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Congress of Vienna. When Belgium declared independence from the Netherlands in 1839, Luxembourg lost more than half of its territory to Belgium but gained a larger measure of autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&nbsp; Luxembourg gained full independence in 1867 by promising to remain permanently neutral. Overrun by Germany in both world wars, its neutrality ended in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the EEC (later the EU), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency zone.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, between France and Germany\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  49 45 N, 6 10 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    2,586 sq km\n  Land:\n    2,586 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than Rhode Island; about half the size of Delaware\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    327 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Belgium 130 km; France 69 km; Germany 128 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  modified continental with mild winters, cool summers\nTerrain:\n  mostly gently rolling uplands with broad, shallow valleys; uplands to slightly mountainous in the north; steep slope down to Moselle flood plain in the southeast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Buurgplaatz 559 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Moselle River 133 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    325 m\nNatural Resources:\n  iron ore (no longer exploited), arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    51.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 24.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 26.7% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    34.5% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    14.2% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2012)\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most people live in the south, on or near the border with France\nNatural Hazards:\n  occasional flooding\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    671,254 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    338,702\n  Female:\n    332,552\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Luxembourger(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Luxembourg\nEthnic Groups:\n  Luxembourger 52.9%, Portuguese 14.5%, French 7.6%, Italian 3.7%, Belgian 3%, German 2%, Spanish 1.3%, Romania 1%, other 14% (2022 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by nationality\nLanguages:\n  Luxembourgish (official administrative, judicial, and national language) 48.9%, Portuguese 15.4%, French (official administrative, judicial, and legislative language) 14.9%, Italian 3.6%, English 3.6%, German (official administrative and judicial language) 2.9%, other 10.8% (2021 est.)\nReligions:\n  Christian (predominantly Roman Catholic) 70.6%, Muslim 2.3%, other (includes Buddhist, folk religions, Hindu, Jewish) 0.4%, unaffiliated 26.7% (2020 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    16.7% (male 57,921/female 54,484)\n  15-64 Years:\n    67.1% (male 231,214/female 219,497)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    16.1% (2024 est.)
