Czech Republic - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia, a parliamentarian democracy. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence when the pro-Soviet Communist party staged a coup in February 1948. In 1968, an invasion by fellow Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create "socialism with a human face," ushering in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. The country formally added the short-form name Czechia in 2016, while also continuing to use the full form name, the Czech Republic.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, between Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  49 45 N, 15 30 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    78,867 sq km\n  Land:\n    77,247 sq km\n  Water:\n    1,620 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about two-thirds the size of Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than South Carolina\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,046 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 402 km; Germany 704 km; Poland 699 km; Slovakia 241 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  temperate; cool summers; cold, cloudy, humid winters\nTerrain:\n  Bohemia in the west consists of rolling plains, hills, and plateaus surrounded by low mountains; Moravia in the east consists of very hilly country\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Snezka 1,602 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Labe (Elbe) River 115 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    433 m\nNatural Resources:\n  hard coal, soft coal, kaolin, clay, graphite, timber, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    45.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 32.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 13% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    34.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    19.5% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  220 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Labe (Elbe) river source (shared with Germany [m]) - 1,252 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, but the northern and eastern regions tend to have larger urban concentrations\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding\nGeography - Note:\n  note 1: landlocked; strategically located on some of oldest and most significant land routes in Europe; Moravian Gate is a traditional military corridor between the North European Plain and the Danube in central Europenote 2: the Hranice Abyss in Czechia is the world's deepest surveyed freshwater cave at 519 m (1,703 ft); its survey is not complete, and it may be up to 800-1,200 m (2,625-3,937 ft) deep\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    10,837,890 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    5,335,737\n  Female:\n    5,502,153\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Czech(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Czech\nEthnic Groups:\n  Czech 57.3%, Moravian 3.4%, other 7.7%, unspecified 31.6% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: includes only persons with one ethnicity\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Czech (official) 88.4%, Slovak 1.5%, other 2.6%, unspecified 7.2% (2021 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    World Factbook, nepostradatelný zdroj základních informací.
