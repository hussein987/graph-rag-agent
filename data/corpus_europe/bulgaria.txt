Bulgaria - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks overran the country. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878, and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004, the EU in 2007, and the Schengen Area for air and sea travel in 2024.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southeastern Europe, bordering the Black Sea, between Romania and Turkey\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  43 00 N, 25 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    110,879 sq km\n  Land:\n    108,489 sq km\n  Water:\n    2,390 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  almost identical in size to Virginia; slightly larger than Tennessee\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,806 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Greece 472 km; Macedonia 162 km; Romania 605 km; Serbia 344 km; Turkey 223 km\nCoastline:\n  354 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate; cold, damp winters; hot, dry summers\nTerrain:\n  mostly mountains with lowlands in north and southeast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Musala 2,925 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Black Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    472 m\nNatural Resources:\n  bauxite, copper, lead, zinc, coal, timber, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    46.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 31.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 13% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    36.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    17.6% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  929 sq km (2016)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dunav (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  earthquakes; landslides\nGeography - Note:\n  strategic location near Turkish Straits; controls key land routes from Europe to Middle East and Asia\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    6,782,659 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    3,303,491\n  Female:\n    3,479,168\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Bulgarian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Bulgarian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Bulgarian 78.5%, Turkish 7.8%, Roma 4.1%, other 1.2%, unspecified 9.4% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: Romani populations are usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 9–11% of Bulgaria's population\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Bulgarian (official) 77.3%, Turkish 7.9%, Romani 3.5%, other 1%, unspecified 10.4% (2021 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Светoвен Алманах, незаменимият източник за основна информация.
