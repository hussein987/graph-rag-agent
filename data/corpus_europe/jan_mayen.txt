Jan Mayen - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  This desolate, mountainous island in the Arctic Ocean was named after a Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614 (earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by seal hunters and trappers over the centuries, the island came under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant Beerenberg volcano, the northernmost active volcano on earth, resumed activity in 1970, and the most recent eruption occurred in 1985.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Northern Europe, island between the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea, northeast of Iceland\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  71 00 N, 8 00 W\nMap References:\n  Arctic Region\nArea:\n  Total :\n    377 sq km\n  Land:\n    377 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly more than twice the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  124.1 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  arctic maritime with frequent storms and persistent fog\nTerrain:\n  volcanic island, partly covered by glaciers\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Haakon VII Toppen on Beerenberg 2,277\n  Lowest Point:\n    Norwegian/Greenland Seas 0 m\n  Note: note: Beerenberg volcano has numerous peaks; the highest point on the volcano rim is named Haakon VII Toppen, after Norway's first king following the reestablishment of Norwegian independence in 1905\nNatural Resources:\n  none\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    0% (2011 est.)\n  Other:\n    100% (2018 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2022)\nNatural Hazards:\n  dominated by the volcano Beerenbergvolcanism: Beerenberg (2,227 m) is Norway's only active volcano; volcanic activity resumed in 1970; the most recent eruption occurred in 1985\nGeography - Note:\n  barren volcanic spoon-shaped island with some moss and grass flora; island consists of two parts: a larger northeast Nord-Jan (the spoon "bowl") and the smaller Sor-Jan (the "handle"), linked by a 2.5 km-wide isthmus (the "stem") with two large lakes, Sorlaguna (South Lagoon) and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon)\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    no permanent inhabitants\n  Note: note: military personnel present on the south side of the island; meteorological stations\n\n## Environment\nEnvironment - Current Issues:\n  pollutants transported from southerly latitudes by winds and ocean currents\nClimate:\n  arctic maritime with frequent storms and persistent fog\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    0% (2011 est.)\n  Other:\n    100% (2018 est.)\n\n## Government\nCountry Name:\n  Conventional Long Form:\n    none\n  Conventional Short Form:\n    Jan Mayen\n  Etymology:\n    named after Dutch Captain Jan Jacobszoon MAY, one of the first explorers to reach the island in 1614\nDependency Status:\n  territory of Norway; since 1994, administered from Oslo through the county governor (fylkesmann) of Nordland; however, authority has been delegated to a station commander of the Norwegian Defense Communication Service; in 2010, Norway designated the majority of Jan Mayen as a nature reserve\nLegal System:\n  the laws of Norway apply\nFlag Description:\n  the flag of Norway is used\n\n## Communications\nBroadcast Media:\n  a coastal radio station has been remotely operated since 1994\n\n## Military And Security\nMilitary - Note:\n  defense is the responsibility of Norway\n
