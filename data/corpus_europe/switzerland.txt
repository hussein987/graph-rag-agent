Switzerland - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848, which was modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce referenda on proposed laws, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. The major European powers have long honored Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality, and the country was not involved in either World War. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half-century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, east of France, north of Italy\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  47 00 N, 8 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    41,277 sq km\n  Land:\n    39,997 sq km\n  Water:\n    1,280 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly less than twice the size of New Jersey\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,770 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 158 km; France 525 km; Italy 698 km; Liechtenstein 41 km; Germany 348 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  temperate, but varies with altitude; cold, cloudy, rainy/snowy winters; cool to warm, cloudy, humid summers with occasional showers\nTerrain:\n  mostly mountains (Alps in south, Jura in northwest) with a central plateau of rolling hills, plains, and large lakes\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Dufourspitze on Monte Rosa 4,634 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Lake Maggiore 195 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    1,350 m\nNatural Resources:\n  hydropower potential, timber, salt\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    37.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 10% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 27.2% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    32.3% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    29.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  494 sq km (2020)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Constance (shared with Germany and Austria) - 540 sq km; Lake Geneva (shared with France) - 580 sq km\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Rhein (Rhine) river source (shared with Germany, France, and Netherlands [m]) - 1,233 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km), (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km), (Adriatic Sea) Po (76,997 sq km), (Mediterranean Sea) Rhone (100,543 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  population distribution corresponds to elevation, with the northern and western areas far more heavily populated; the higher Alps of the south limit settlement\nNatural Hazards:\n  avalanches, landslides; flash floods\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; crossroads of northern and southern Europe; along with southeastern France, northern Italy, and southwestern Austria, has the highest elevations in the Alps\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    8,860,574 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    4,403,105\n  Female:\n    4,457,469\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Swiss (singular and plural)\n  Adjective:\n    Swiss\nEthnic Groups:\n  Swiss 69.2%, German 4.2%, Italian 3.2%, Portuguese 2.5%, French 2.1%, Kosovan 1.1%, Turkish 1%, other 16.7% (2020 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent permanent and non-permanent resident population by country of birth\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    German (or Swiss German) (official) 62.1%, French (official) 22.8%, Italian (official) 8%, English 5.7%, Portuguese 3.5%, Albanian 3.3%, Serbo-Croatian 2.3%, Spanish 2.3%, Romansh (official) 0.5%, other 7.9% (2019 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Das World Factbook, die unverzichtbare Quelle für grundlegende Informationen.
