Moldova - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  A large portion of present-day Moldovan territory became a province of the Russian Empire in 1812 and then unified with Romania in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I. This territory was then incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although Moldova has been independent from the Soviet Union since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Nistru River in the breakaway region of Transnistria. Years of Communist Party rule in Moldova from 2001 to 2009 ultimately ended with election-related violent protests and a rerun of parliamentary elections in 2009. A series of pro-Europe ruling coalitions governed Moldova from 2010 to 2019, but pro-Russia candidate Igor DODON won the presidency in 2016, and his Socialist Party of the Republic of Moldova won a plurality in the legislative election in 2019. Pro-EU reformist candidate Maia SANDU defeated DODON in his reelection bid in 2020, and SANDU's Party of Action and Solidarity won a parliamentary majority in an early legislative election in 2021. Prime Minister Natalia GAVRILITA and her cabinet took office in 2021. In early 2023, Moldova's parliament confirmed a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Dorin RECEAN, which retained the majority of the former ministers.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Eastern Europe, northeast of Romania\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  47 00 N, 29 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    33,851 sq km\n  Land:\n    32,891 sq km\n  Water:\n    960 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly larger than Maryland\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,885 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Romania 683 km; Ukraine 1202 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  moderate winters, warm summers\nTerrain:\n  rolling steppe, gradual slope south to Black Sea\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Dealul Balanesti 430 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Dniester (Nistru) 2 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    139 m\nNatural Resources:\n  lignite, phosphorites, gypsum, limestone, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    69.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 52.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 6.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 10.2% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    11.8% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    18.9% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  2,150 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dunărea (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 km; Nistru (Dniester) (shared with Ukraine [s/m]) - 1,411 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  pockets of agglomeration exist throughout the country, with the largest in the center of the country around the capital of Chisinau, followed by Tiraspol and Balti\nNatural Hazards:\n  landslides\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; has many types of sedimentary rocks and minerals, including sand, gravel, gypsum, and limestone\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    3,599,528 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    1,698,249\n  Female:\n    1,901,279\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Moldovan(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Moldovan\nEthnic Groups:\n  Moldovan 75.1%, Romanian 7%, Ukrainian 6.6%, Gagauz 4.6%, Russian 4.1%, Bulgarian 1.9%, other 0.8% (2014 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Moldovan/Romanian 80.2% (official) (56.7% Moldovan; 23.5% Romanian), Russian 9.7%, Gagauz 4.2% (a Turkish language), Ukrainian 3.9%, Bulgarian 1.5%, Romani 0.3%, other 0.2% (2014)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Cartea informativa a lumii, sursa indispensabila pentru informatii de baza.
