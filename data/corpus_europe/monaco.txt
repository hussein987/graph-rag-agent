Monaco - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present-day Monaco in 1215. The current ruling GRIMALDI family first seized control in 1297 but was not able to permanently secure its holding until 1419. Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's mild climate, coastal Mediterranean scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world-famous as a tourist and recreation center.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea on the southern coast of France, near the border with Italy\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  43 44 N, 7 24 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    2 sq km\n  Land:\n    2 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about three times the size of the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    6 km\n  Border Countries:\n    France 6 km\nCoastline:\n  4.1 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers\nTerrain:\n  hilly, rugged, rocky\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Chemin des Revoires on Mont Agel 162 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Mediterranean Sea 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  none\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 0% (2018 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1% (2018 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 0% (2018 est.)\n  Forest:\n    0% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    100% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2022)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  the second most densely populated country in the world (after Macau); its entire population lives on 2 sq km (0.8 sq mi)\nNatural Hazards:\n  none\nGeography - Note:\n  second-smallest independent state in the world (after the Holy See); smallest country with a coastline; almost entirely urban\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    31,813 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    15,366\n  Female:\n    16,447\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Monegasque(s) or Monacan(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Monegasque or Monacan\nEthnic Groups:\n  Monegasque 32.1%, French 19.9%, Italian 15.3%, British 5%, Belgian 2.3%, Swiss 2%, German 1.9%, Russian 1.8%, American 1.1%, Dutch 1.1%, Moroccan 1%, other 16.6% (2016 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by country of birth\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    French (official), English, Italian, Monegasque\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    The World Factbook, une source indispensable d'informations de base.
