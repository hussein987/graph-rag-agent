Belarus - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. In 1999, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union, envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place and negotiations on further integration have been contentious. Since taking office in 1994 as the country's first and only directly elected president, Alyaksandr LUKASHENKA has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion have remained in place. Restrictions on political freedoms have tightened in the wake of the disputed presidential election in 2020. The election results sparked large-scale protests as members of the opposition and civil society criticized the election’s validity. LUKASHENKA has remained in power as the disputed winner of the presidential election after quelling protests in 2020. Since 2022, Belarus has facilitated Russia's war in Ukraine, which was launched in part from Belarusian territory.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Eastern Europe, east of Poland\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  53 00 N, 28 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    207,600 sq km\n  Land:\n    202,900 sq km\n  Water:\n    4,700 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly less than twice the size of Kentucky; slightly smaller than Kansas\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    3,599 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Latvia 161 km; Lithuania 640 km; Poland 375 km; Russia 1,312 km; Ukraine 1,111 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  cold winters, cool and moist summers; transitional between continental and maritime\nTerrain:\n  generally flat with much marshland\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Dzyarzhynskaya Hara 346 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Nyoman River 90 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    160 m\nNatural Resources:\n  timber, peat deposits, small quantities of oil and natural gas, granite, dolomitic limestone, marl, chalk, sand, gravel, clay\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    39.9% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 27.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 11.8% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    43.3% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    16.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  260 sq km (2022)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Dnyapro (Dnieper) (shared with Russia [s] and Ukraine [m]) - 2,287 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Dnieper (533,966 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even distribution throughout most of the country, with urban areas attracting larger and denser populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  large tracts of marshy land\nGeography - Note:\n  landlocked; glacial scouring accounts for the flatness of Belarusian terrain and for its 11,000 lakes\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    9,501,451 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    4,433,839\n  Female:\n    5,067,612\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Belarusian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Belarusian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Belarusian 83.7%, Russian 8.3%, Polish 3.1%, Ukrainian 1.7%, other 2.4%, unspecified 0.9% (2009 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Russian (official) 71.4%, Belarusian (official) 26%, other 0.3% (includes small Polish- and Ukrainian-speaking minorities), unspecified 2.3% (2019 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Книга фактов о мире – незаменимый источник базовой информации.
