Faroe Islands - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Faroe Islands were already populated by about A.D. 500, but whether the original settlers were Celtic or early Norse (or someone else) has yet to be determined. Viking settlers arrived on the islands in the 9th century, and the islands served as an important stepping stone for medieval Viking exploration of the North Atlantic. The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century, and today the Faroe Islands are a self-governing dependency of Denmark. The Home Rule Act of 1948 granted a high degree of self-government to the Faroese, who have autonomy over most internal affairs and external trade, while Denmark is responsible for justice, defense, and some foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Northern Europe, island group between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Iceland and Norway\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  62 00 N, 7 00 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    1,393 sq km\n  Land:\n    1,393 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km (some lakes and streams)\nArea - Comparative:\n  eight times the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  1,117 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    200 nm or agreed boundaries or median line\nClimate:\n  mild winters, cool summers; usually overcast; foggy, windy\nTerrain:\n  rugged, rocky, some low peaks; cliffs along most of coast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Slaettaratindur 882 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Atlantic Ocean 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  fish, whales, hydropower, possible oil and gas\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    70.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 0.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 70.1% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    0.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    29.8% (2022 est.)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  the island of Streymoy is by far the most populous with over 40% of the population; it has approximately twice as many inhabitants as Eysturoy, the second most populous island; seven of the inhabited islands have fewer than 100 people\nNatural Hazards:\n  strong winds and heavy rains can occur throughout the year\nGeography - Note:\n  archipelago of 17 inhabited islands, one uninhabited island, and a few uninhabited islets; strategically located along important sea lanes in northeastern Atlantic; precipitous terrain limits habitation to small coastal lowlands\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    52,933 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    27,400\n  Female:\n    25,533\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Faroese (singular and plural)\n  Adjective:\n    Faroese\nEthnic Groups:\n  Faroese 83.8% (Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon descent), Danish 8.3%, Filipino 1.2%, other Nordic 0.9%, other 4.5% (includes Polish and Romanian) (2024 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent respondents by country of birth\nLanguages:\n  Faroese 93.8% (derived from Old Norse), Danish 3.2%, other 3% (2011 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by primary language\nReligions:\n  Christian 87% (predominantly Evangelical Lutheran), other 0.9%, none 3.7%, unspecified 8.9% (2011 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    20% (male 5,489/female 5,122)\n  15-64 Years:\n    61.5% (male 17,188/female 15,346)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    18.5% (2024 est.)
