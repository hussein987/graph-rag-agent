Malta - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  With a civilization that dates back thousands of years, Malta boasts some of the oldest megalithic sites in the world. Situated in the center of the Mediterranean, Malta&rsquo;s islands have long served as a strategic military asset, with the islands at various times falling under the control of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, and French. Most recently a British colony (since 1814), Malta gained its independence in 1964 and declared itself a republic 10 years later. While under British rule, the island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars. Since the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist destination, as its key industries moved toward more service-oriented activities. Malta became an EU member in 2004 and joined the eurozone in 2008.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southern Europe, islands in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily (Italy)\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  35 50 N, 14 35 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    316 sq km\n  Land:\n    316 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly less than twice the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  196.8 km (excludes 56 km for the island of Gozo)\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    25 nm\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean; mild, rainy winters; hot, dry summers\nTerrain:\n  mostly low, rocky, flat to dissected plains; many coastal cliffs\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Ta'Dmejrek on Dingli Cliffs 253 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Mediterranean Sea 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  limestone, salt, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    27.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 24.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    1.4% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    71.2% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  39 sq km (2022)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most of the population lives on the eastern half of Malta, the largest of the three inhabited islands\nNatural Hazards:\n  occasional droughts\nGeography - Note:\n  the country is an archipelago, with only the three largest islands (Malta, Ghawdex or Gozo, and Kemmuna or Comino) inhabited; numerous bays provide good harbors\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    469,730 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    237,023\n  Female:\n    232,707\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Maltese (singular and plural)\n  Adjective:\n    Maltese\nEthnic Groups:\n  Maltese (descendants of ancient Carthaginians and Phoenicians with strong elements of Italian and other Mediterranean stock)\nLanguages:\n  Maltese (official) 90.1%, English (official) 6%, multilingual 3%, other 0.9% (2005 est.)\nReligions:\n  Roman Catholic (official) more than 90% (2006 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    14.5% (male 35,034/female 33,181)\n  15-64 Years:\n    62.4% (male 151,836/female 141,248)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    23.1% (2024 est.)
