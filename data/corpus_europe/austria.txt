Austria - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and the victorious Allies then occupied the country in 1945. As a result, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade after World War II, until a State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. Austria joined the EU in 1995, but the obligation to remain neutral kept it from joining NATO, although the country became a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1995. Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, north of Italy and Slovenia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  47 20 N, 13 20 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    83,871 sq km\n  Land:\n    82,445 sq km\n  Water:\n    1,426 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about the size of South Carolina; slightly more than two-thirds the size of Pennsylvania\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    2,524 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Czech Republic 402 km; Germany 801 km; Hungary 321 km; Italy 404 km; Liechtenstein 34 km; Slovakia 105 km; Slovenia 299 km; Switzerland 158 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  temperate; continental, cloudy; cold winters with frequent rain and some snow in lowlands and snow in mountains; moderate summers with occasional showers\nTerrain:\n  mostly mountains (Alps) in the west and south; mostly flat or gently sloping along the eastern and northern margins\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Grossglockner 3,798 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Neusiedler See 115 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    910 m\nNatural Resources:\n  oil, coal, lignite, timber, iron ore, copper, zinc, antimony, magnesite, tungsten, graphite, salt, hydropower\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    31.5% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 16% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 14.7% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    47.2% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    21.3% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  382 sq km (2016)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Constance (shared with Switzerland and Germany) - 540 sq km\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Donau (Danube) (shared with Germany [s], Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km), (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  the northern and eastern portions of the country are more densely populated; nearly two thirds of the populace lives in urban areas\nNatural Hazards:\n  landslides; avalanches; earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  note 1: landlocked; strategic location at the crossroads of central Europe with many easily traversable Alpine passes and valleys; major river is the Danube; population is concentrated on eastern lowlands because of steep slopes, poor soils, and low temperatures elsewherenote 2: the world's largest and longest ice cave system at 42 km (26 mi) is the Eisriesenwelt (Ice Giants World) inside the Hochkogel mountain near Werfen, about 40 km south of Salzburg; ice caves are bedrock caves that contain year-round ice formations; they differ from glacial caves, which are transient and are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    8,967,982 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    4,392,898\n  Female:\n    4,575,084\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Austrian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Austrian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Austrian 80.8%, German 2.6%, Bosnian and Herzegovinian 1.9%, Turkish 1.8%, Serbian 1.6%, Romanian 1.3%, other 10% (2018 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by country of birth\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    German (official nationwide) 88.6%, Turkish 2.3%, Serbian 2.2%, Croatian (official in Burgenland) 1.6%, other (includes Slovene, official in southern Carinthia, and Hungarian, official in Burgenland) 5.3% (2001 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Das World Factbook, die unverzichtbare Quelle für grundlegende Informationen.
