Netherlands - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in 1581; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world. After 18 years of French domination, the Netherlands regained its independence in 1813. In 1830, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -- Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba -- became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 2018, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing body) was dissolved and replaced by a government commissioner to restore the integrity of public administration. According to the Dutch Government, the intervention will be as "short as possible and as long as needed."\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, bordering the North Sea, between Belgium and Germany\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  52 31 N, 5 46 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    41,543 sq km\n  Land:\n    33,893 sq km\n  Water:\n    7,650 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly less than twice the size of New Jersey\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,053 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Belgium 478 km; Germany 575 km\nCoastline:\n  451 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    200 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate; marine; cool summers and mild winters\nTerrain:\n  mostly coastal lowland and reclaimed land (polders); some hills in southeast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Mount Scenery (on the island of Saba in the Caribbean, now considered an integral part of the Netherlands following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) 862 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Zuidplaspolder -7 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    30 m\n  Note: note: the highest point on continental Netherlands is Vaalserberg at 322 m\nNatural Resources:\n  natural gas, petroleum, peat, limestone, salt, sand and gravel, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    53.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 29.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 1.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 22.7% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    11% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    35.4% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  2,969 sq km (2019)\nMajor Rivers (By Length In Km):\n  Rijn (Rhine) river mouth (shared with Switzerland [s], Germany, and France) - 1,233 kmnote: [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  an area known as the Randstad, anchored by the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, and Utrecht, is the most densely populated region; the north tends to be less dense, but sizeable communities can be found throughout the entire country\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding volcanism: Mount Scenery (887 m), located on the island of Saba in the Caribbean, last erupted in 1640; Round Hill (601 m), a dormant volcano also known as The Quill, is located on the island of St. Eustatius in the Caribbean; these islands are at the northern end of the volcanic island arc of the Lesser Antilles that extends south to Grenada\nGeography - Note:\n  located at mouths of three major European rivers (Rhine (Rijn), Meuse (Maas), and Scheldt (Schelde)); about a quarter of the country lies below sea level and only about half of the land exceeds one meter above sea level\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    17,772,378 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    8,844,100\n  Female:\n    8,928,278\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Dutchman(men), Dutchwoman(women)\n  Adjective:\n    Dutch\nEthnic Groups:\n  Dutch 75.4%, EU (excluding Dutch) 6.4%, Turkish 2.4%, Moroccan 2.4%, Surinamese 2.1%, Indonesian 2%, other 9.3% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Dutch (official), Frisian (official in Fryslan province)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Het Wereld Feitenboek, een onmisbare bron van informatie.
