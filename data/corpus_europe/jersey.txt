Jersey - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy that held sway in both France and England. These islands were the only British soil that Germany occupied in World War II. The Bailiwick of Jersey is a British Crown dependency, which means that it is not part of the UK but is rather a self-governing possession of the British Crown. However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, island in the English Channel, northwest of France\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  49 15 N, 2 10 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    116 sq km\n  Land:\n    116 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about two-thirds the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  70 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate; mild winters and cool summers\nTerrain:\n  gently rolling plain with low, rugged hills along north coast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Les Platons 136 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    English Channel 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    43.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 18.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 24.9% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    5.2% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    51.6% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  NA\nPopulation Distribution:\n  fairly even distribution\nNatural Hazards:\n  very large tidal variation can be hazardous to navigation\nGeography - Note:\n  largest and southernmost of Channel Islands; about 30% of population concentrated in Saint Helier\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    103,387 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    51,028\n  Female:\n    52,359\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Channel Islander(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Channel Islander\nEthnic Groups:\n  Jersey 44.4%, British 30.5%, Portuguese/Madeiran 9.4%, Polish 3%, Irish 2.1%, other 10.6% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  English (official) 94.5%, Portuguese 4.6%, other 0.9% (includes French (official) and Jerriais) (2001 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent main spoken language; the traditional language of Jersey is Jerriais or Jersey French (a Norman language), which was spoken by fewer than 3,000 people as of 2001; two thirds of Jerriais speakers are aged 60 and over\nReligions:\n  Christian 85.2%, Baha'i 0.3%, Hindu 0.1%, Jewish 0.1%, Muslim 0.1%, atheist 1.1%, agnostic 13.1% (2020 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    17% (male 9,082/female 8,530)\n  15-64 Years:\n    64.6% (male 33,840/female 32,989)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    18.3% (2024 est.)
