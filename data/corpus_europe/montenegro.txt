Montenegro - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The use of the name Crna Gora or Black Mountain (Montenegro) began in the 13th century in reference to a highland region in the Serbian province of Zeta. Under Ottoman control beginning in 1496, Montenegro was a semi-autonomous theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes until 1852, when it became a secular principality. Montenegro fought a series of wars with the Ottomans and eventually won recognition as an independent sovereign principality at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In 1918, the country was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. At the end of World War II, Montenegro joined the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). When the SFRY dissolved in 1992, Montenegro and Serbia created the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which shifted in 2003 to a looser State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro voted to restore its independence on 3 June 2006. Montenegro became an official EU candidate in 2010 and joined NATO in 2017.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southeastern Europe, between the Adriatic Sea and Serbia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  42 30 N, 19 18 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    13,812 sq km\n  Land:\n    13,452 sq km\n  Water:\n    360 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly smaller than Connecticut; slightly larger than twice the size of Delaware\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    680 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Albania 186 km; Bosnia and Herzegovina 242 km; Croatia 19 km; Kosovo 76 km; Serbia 157 km\nCoastline:\n  293.5 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    defined by treaty\nClimate:\n  Mediterranean climate, hot dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfalls inland\nTerrain:\n  highly indented coastline with narrow coastal plain backed by rugged high limestone mountains and plateaus\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Zia Kolata 2,534 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Adriatic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    1,086 m\nNatural Resources:\n  bauxite, hydroelectricity\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    18.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 0.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 17.8% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    61.5% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    19.7% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  24 sq km (2012)\nMajor Lakes (Area Sq Km):\n  Fresh Water Lake(S):\n    Lake Scutari (shared with Albania) - 400 sq kmnote - largest lake in the Balkans\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  highest population density is concentrated in the south and southwest; the extreme eastern border is the least populated area\nNatural Hazards:\n  destructive earthquakes\nGeography - Note:\n  strategic location along the Adriatic coast\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    599,849 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    294,482\n  Female:\n    305,367\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Montenegrin(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Montenegrin\nEthnic Groups:\n  Montenegrin 45%, Serbian 28.7%, Bosniak 8.7%, Albanian 4.9%, Muslim 3.3%, Romani 1%, Croat 1%, other 2.6%, unspecified 4.9% (2011 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Serbian 42.9%, Montenegrin (official) 37%, Bosnian 5.3%, Albanian 5.3%, Serbo-Croat 2%, other 3.5%, unspecified 4% (2011 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Knjiga svetskih činjenica, neophodan izvor osnovnih informacija.
