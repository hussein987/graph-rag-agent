Cyprus - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 after years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued and forced most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), but it is recognized only by Turkey. A UN-mediated agreement to reunite Cyprus, the Annan Plan, failed to win approval from both communities in 2004. The most recent round of reunification negotiations was suspended in 2017 after failure to achieve a breakthrough. The entire island joined the EU in 2004, although the EU acquis -- the body of common rights and obligations -- applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government and is suspended in the TRNC. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship have the same legal rights accorded to citizens of other EU states.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey; note - Cyprus views itself as part of Europe; geopolitically, it can be classified as falling within Europe, the Middle East, or both\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  35 00 N, 33 00 E\nMap References:\n  Middle East\nArea:\n  Total :\n    9,251 sq km (of which 3,355 sq km are in north Cyprus)\n  Land:\n    9,241 sq km\n  Water:\n    10 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about 0.6 times the size of Connecticut\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    156 km\n  Border Sovereign Base Areas:\n    Akrotiri 48 km; Dhekelia 108 km\nCoastline:\n  648 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  temperate; Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool winters\nTerrain:\n  central plain with mountains to north and south; scattered but significant plains along southern coast\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Mount Olympus 1,951 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Mediterranean Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    91 m\nNatural Resources:\n  copper, pyrites, asbestos, gypsum, timber, salt, marble, clay earth pigment\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    13.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 10.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 2.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 0.2% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    18.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    68% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  269 sq km (2020)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  population concentrated in central Nicosia and in the major cities of the south: Paphos, Limassol, and Larnaca\nNatural Hazards:\n  moderate earthquake activity; droughts\nGeography - Note:\n  the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and Sardinia)\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    1,320,525 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    675,196\n  Female:\n    645,329\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Cypriot(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Cypriot\nEthnic Groups:\n  Greek 98.8%, other 1% (includes Maronite, Armenian, Turkish-Cypriot), unspecified 0.2% (2011 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent only the Greek-Cypriot citizens in the Republic of Cyprus\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Greek (official) 80.9%, Turkish (official) 0.2%, English 4.1%, Romanian 2.9%, Russian 2.5%, Bulgarian 2.2%, Arabic 1.2%, Filipino 1.1%, other 4.3%, unspecified 0.6%&nbsp; (2011 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Το Παγκόσμιο Βιβλίο Δεδομένων, η απαραίτητη πηγή βασικών πληροφοριών.

self-declared "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC) - parliamentary republic with enhanced presidency\n  Note: note: a separation of the two main ethnic communities inhabiting the island began following the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this separation was further solidified when a Greek military-junta-supported coup attempt prompted the Turkish military intervention in July 1974 that gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots control the only internationally recognized government on the island; on 15 November 1983, then Turkish Cypriot "President" Rauf DENKTAS declared independence and the formation of the "TRNC,” which is recognized only by Turkey\nCapital:\n  Name:\n    Nicosia (Lefkosia/Lefkosa)\n  Geographic Coordinates:\n    35 10 N, 33 22 E\n  Time Difference:\n    UTC+2 (7 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)\n  Daylight Saving Time:\n    +1hr, begins last Sunday in March;

Its market-based economy is roughly one-fifth the size of its southern neighbor and is likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of the population employed by the government. Manufacturing is limited mainly to food and beverages, furniture and fixtures, construction materials, metal and non-metal products, textiles and clothing. Little trade exists with the Republic of Cyprus outside of construction, historically relying heavily upon Turkey for financial aid, defense, telecommunications, utilities, and postal services.

Criminals have reportedly used ROC banks to launder proceeds, particularly from Russian and Ukrainian illicit activity.\n
