Guernsey - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy, which held sway in both France and England. The islands were the only British soil that Germany occupied in World War II. The Bailiwick of Guernsey consists of the main island of Guernsey and a number of smaller islands, including Alderney, Sark, Herm, Jethou, Brecqhou, and Lihou. The Bailiwick is a self-governing British Crown dependency that is not part of the UK. However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, islands in the English Channel, northwest of France\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  49 28 N, 2 35 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    78 sq km\n  Land:\n    78 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\n  Note: note: includes Alderney, Guernsey, Herm, Sark, and some other smaller islands\nArea - Comparative:\n  about one-half the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  50 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate with mild winters and cool summers; about 50% of days are overcast\nTerrain:\n  mostly flat with low hills in southwest\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Le Moulin on Sark 114 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    English Channel 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  cropland\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    43.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 18.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 24.9% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    5.2% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    51.6% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  NA\nNatural Hazards:\n  very large tidal variation and fast currents can make local waters dangerous\nGeography - Note:\n  large, deepwater harbor at Saint Peter Port\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    67,787 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    33,712\n  Female:\n    34,075\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Channel Islander(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Channel Islander\nEthnic Groups:\n  Guernsey 53.5%, UK and Ireland 23.8%, Portugal 2.1%, Latvia 1.4%, other Europe 2.7%, other Crown Dependencies 0.7%, other 5.3%, unspecified 10.5% (2022 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by country of birth; the native population is of British and Norman-French descent\nLanguages:\n  English, French, Norman-French dialect spoken in country districts\nReligions:\n  Protestant (Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, Congregational, Methodist), Roman Catholic\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    14.3% (male 4,999/female 4,717)\n  15-64 Years:\n    64.1% (male 21,937/female 21,547)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    21.5% (2024 est.)
