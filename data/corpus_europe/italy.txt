Italy - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946, and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO, as well as the European Economic Community (EEC) and its successors, the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Southern Europe, a peninsula extending into the central Mediterranean Sea, northeast of Tunisia\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  42 50 N, 12 50 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    301,340 sq km\n  Land:\n    294,140 sq km\n  Water:\n    7,200 sq km\n  Note: note: includes Sardinia and Sicily\nArea - Comparative:\n  almost twice the size of Georgia; slightly larger than Arizona\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,836.4 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 404 km; France 476 km; Holy See (Vatican City) 3.4 km; San Marino 37 km; Slovenia 218 km; Switzerland 698 km\nCoastline:\n  7,600 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  predominantly Mediterranean; alpine in far north; hot, dry in south\nTerrain:\n  mostly rugged and mountainous; some plains, coastal lowlands\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) de Courmayeur (a secondary peak of Mont Blanc) 4,748 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Mediterranean Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    538 m\nNatural Resources:\n  coal, antimony, mercury, zinc, potash, marble, barite, asbestos, pumice, fluorspar, feldspar, pyrite (sulfur), natural gas and crude oil reserves, fish, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    44% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 24% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 8.1% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 11.9% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    32.7% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    23.3% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  24,460 sq km (2021)\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km), (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km), (Adriatic Sea) Po (76,997 sq km), (Mediterranean Sea) Rhone (100,543 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  a fairly even population distribution exists throughout most of the country, with coastal areas, the Po River Valley, and urban centers (particularly Milan, Rome, and Naples) attracting larger and denser populations\nNatural Hazards:\n  regional risks include landslides, mudflows, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding; land subsidence in Venice volcanism: significant volcanic activity; Etna (3,330 m), which is in eruption as of 2013, is Europe's most active volcano; flank eruptions pose a threat to nearby Sicilian villages; Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius, which remains a threat to the millions of nearby residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Stromboli, on its namesake island, has also been continuously active with moderate volcanic activity; other historically active volcanoes include Campi Flegrei, Ischia, Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini\nGeography - Note:\n  strategic location dominating central Mediterranean, as well as southern sea and air approaches to Western Europe\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    60,964,931 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    29,414,065\n  Female:\n    31,550,866\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Italian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Italian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Italian (includes small clusters of German-, French-, and Slovene-Italians in the north, Albanian-Italians, Croat-Italians, and Greek-Italians in the south)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Italian (official), German (parts of Trentino-Alto Adige region are predominantly German-speaking), French (small French-speaking minority in Valle d'Aosta region), Slovene (Slovene-speaking minority in the Trieste-Gorizia area), Croatian (in Molise)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    L'Almanacco dei fatti del mondo, l'indispensabile fonte per le informazioni di base.
