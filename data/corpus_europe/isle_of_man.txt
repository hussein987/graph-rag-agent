Isle of Man - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Isle of Man was part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century, when it was ceded to Scotland. The isle came under English lordship in the 14th century before being purchased by the British Government in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost extinct Manx Gaelic language. The Isle of Man is a British Crown dependency, which makes it a self-governing possession of the British Crown that is not part of the UK. The UK Government, however, remains constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Western Europe, island in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Ireland\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  54 15 N, 4 30 W\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    572 sq km\n  Land:\n    572 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly more than three times the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    0 km\nCoastline:\n  160 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Fishing Zone:\n    12 nm\nClimate:\n  temperate; cool summers and mild winters; overcast about a third of the time\nTerrain:\n  hills in north and south bisected by central valley\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Snaefell 621 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Irish Sea 0 m\nNatural Resources:\n  none\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    71.4% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 42.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 29.1% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    6.1% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    22.5% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2022)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most people concentrated in cities and large towns; Douglas, in the southeast, is the largest\nNatural Hazards:\n  occasional high winds and rough seas\nGeography - Note:\n  one small islet, the Calf of Man, lies to the southwest and is a bird sanctuary\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    92,269 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    46,331\n  Female:\n    45,938\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Manxman (men), Manxwoman (women)\n  Adjective:\n    Manx\nEthnic Groups:\n  White 94.7%, Asian 3.1%, Mixed 1%, Black 0.6%, other 0.4% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by nationality\nLanguages:\n  English, Manx Gaelic (about 2% of the population has some knowledge)\nReligions:\n  Christian 54.7%, Muslim 0.5%, Buddhist 0.5%, Hindu 0.4%, Jewish 0.2%, none 43.8% (2021 est.)\nAge Structure:\n  0-14 Years:\n    16% (male 7,701/female 7,100)\n  15-64 Years:\n    61.9% (male 29,035/female 28,044)\n  65 Years And Over:\n    22.1% (2024 est.)
