Liechtenstein - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the German Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Central Europe, between Austria and Switzerland\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  47 16 N, 9 32 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    160 sq km\n  Land:\n    160 sq km\n  Water:\n    0 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  about 0.9 times the size of Washington, D.C.\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    75 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Austria 34 km; Switzerland 41 km\nCoastline:\n  0 km (doubly landlocked)\nMaritime Claims:\n  none (landlocked)\nClimate:\n  continental; cold, cloudy winters with frequent snow or rain; cool to moderately warm, cloudy, humid summers\nTerrain:\n  mostly mountainous (Alps) with Rhine Valley in western third\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Vorder-Grauspitz 2,599 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Ruggeller Riet 430 m\nNatural Resources:\n  hydroelectric potential, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    32.3% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 10.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 21.5% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    41.9% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    25.8% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  0 sq km (2012)\nMajor Watersheds (Area Sq Km):\n  Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  most of the population is found in the western half of the country along the Rhine River\nNatural Hazards:\n  avalanches, landslides\nGeography - Note:\n  along with Uzbekistan, one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world; variety of microclimatic variations based on elevation\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    40,272 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    20,072\n  Female:\n    20,200\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Liechtensteiner(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Liechtenstein\nEthnic Groups:\n  Liechtensteiner 65.6%, Swiss 9.6%, Austrian 5.8%, German 4.5%, Italian 3.1%, other 11.4% (2021 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by nationality\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    German 91.5% (official, Alemannic is the main dialect), Italian 1.5%, Turkish 1.3%, Portuguese 1.1%, other 4.6% (2015 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Das World Factbook, die unverzichtbare Quelle f√ºr grundlegende Informationen.
