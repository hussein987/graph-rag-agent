Latvia - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Several eastern Baltic tribes merged in medieval times to form the ethnic core of the Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.). The region subsequently came under the control of Germans, Poles, Swedes, and finally Russians. A Latvian republic emerged following World War I, but the USSR annexed it in 1940 -- an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. Latvia reestablished its independence in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the Russian minority (some 25% of the population) remains of concern to Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in 2004; it joined the euro zone in 2014 and the OECD in 2016.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Eastern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, between Estonia and Lithuania\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  57 00 N, 25 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    64,589 sq km\n  Land:\n    62,249 sq km\n  Water:\n    2,340 sq km\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly larger than West Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    1,370 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Belarus 161 km; Estonia 333 km; Lithuania 544 km; Russia 332 km\nCoastline:\n  498 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    limits as agreed to by Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden, and Russia\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  maritime; wet, moderate winters\nTerrain:\n  low plain\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Gaizina Kalns 312 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Baltic Sea 0 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    87 m\nNatural Resources:\n  peat, limestone, dolomite, amber, hydropower, timber, arable land\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    31.7% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 21.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.2% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 9.7% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    54.9% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    13.4% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  6 sq km (2016)\n  Note: note: land in Latvia is often too wet and in need of drainage not irrigation; approximately 16,000 sq km or 85% of agricultural land has been improved by drainage\nPopulation Distribution:\n  largest concentration of people is found in and around the port and capital city of Riga; small agglomerations are scattered throughout the country\nNatural Hazards:\n  large percentage of agricultural fields can become waterlogged and require drainage\nGeography - Note:\n  most of the country is composed of fertile low-lying plains with some hills in the east\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    1,801,246 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    836,982\n  Female:\n    964,264\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Latvian(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Latvian\nEthnic Groups:\n  Latvian 62.7%, Russian 24.5%, Belarusian 3.1%, Ukrainian 2.2%, Polish 2%, Lithuanian 1.1%, other 1.8%, unspecified 2.6% (2021 est.)\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Latvian (official) 56.3%, Russian 33.8%, other 0.6% (includes Polish, Ukrainian, and Belarusian), unspecified 9.4%&nbsp; (2011 est.)\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    World Factbook, neaizstājams avots pamata informāciju.
