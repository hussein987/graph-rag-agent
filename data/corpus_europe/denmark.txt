Denmark - Country Information\n==================================================\n\n## Introduction\nBackground:\n  Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is part of the general political and economic integration of Europe.

The country has opted out of certain elements of the EU's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic and Monetary Union and justice and home affairs issues. a 2022 referendum resulted in the removal of Denmark's 30-year opt-out on defense issues, now allowing Denmark to participate fully in the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy.\n\n## Geography\nLocation:\n  Northern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, on a peninsula north of Germany (Jutland); also includes several major islands (Sjaelland, Fyn, and Bornholm)\nGeographic Coordinates:\n  56 00 N, 10 00 E\nMap References:\n  Europe\nArea:\n  Total :\n    43,094 sq km\n  Land:\n    42,434 sq km\n  Water:\n    660 sq km\n  Note: note: includes the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark (the Jutland Peninsula, and the major islands of Sjaelland and Fyn) but excludes the Faroe Islands and Greenland\nArea - Comparative:\n  slightly less than twice the size of Massachusetts; about two-thirds the size of West Virginia\nLand Boundaries:\n  Total:\n    141 km\n  Border Countries:\n    Germany 140 km; Canada 1.3 km\nCoastline:\n  7,314 km\nMaritime Claims:\n  Territorial Sea:\n    12 nm\n  Contiguous Zone:\n    24 nm\n  Exclusive Economic Zone:\n    200 nm\n  Continental Shelf:\n    200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate:\n  temperate; humid and overcast; mild, windy winters and cool summers\nTerrain:\n  low and flat to gently rolling plains\nElevation:\n  Highest Point:\n    Store Mollehoj 171 m\n  Lowest Point:\n    Lammefjord -7 m\n  Mean Elevation:\n    34 m\nNatural Resources:\n  petroleum, natural gas, fish, arable land, salt, limestone, chalk, stone, gravel and sand\nLand Use:\n  Agricultural Land:\n    65.6% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Arable Land:\n    arable land: 59% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Crops:\n    permanent crops: 0.8% (2022 est.)\n  Agricultural Land: Permanent Pasture:\n    permanent pasture: 5.8% (2022 est.)\n  Forest:\n    15.8% (2022 est.)\n  Other:\n    18.6% (2022 est.)\nIrrigated Land:\n  2,420 sq km (2022)\nPopulation Distribution:\n  population centers tend to be along coastal areas, particularly in Copenhagen and the eastern side of the country's mainland\nNatural Hazards:\n  flooding is a threat in some areas of the country (e.g., parts of Jutland, along the southern coast of the island of Lolland) that are protected from the sea by a system of dikes\nGeography - Note:\n  composed of the Jutland Peninsula and a group of more than 400 islands (Danish Archipelago); controls Danish Straits (Skagerrak and Kattegat) linking Baltic and North Seas; about one-quarter of the population lives in greater Copenhagen\n\n## People And Society\nPopulation:\n  Total:\n    5,973,136 (2024 est.)\n  Male:\n    2,975,261\n  Female:\n    2,997,875\nNationality:\n  Noun:\n    Dane(s)\n  Adjective:\n    Danish\nEthnic Groups:\n  Danish (includes Greenlandic (who are predominantly Inuit) and Faroese) 84.2%, Turkish 1.1%, other 14.7% (largest groups are Polish, Romanian, Syrian, Ukrainian, German, and Iraqi) (2023 est.)\n  Note: note: data represent population by country of origin\nLanguages:\n  Languages:\n    Danish, Faroese, Greenlandic (an Inuit dialect), German (small minority); note - English is the predominant second language\n  Major-Language Sample(S):\n    Verdens Faktabog, den uundværlig kilde til grundlæggende oplysninger.
